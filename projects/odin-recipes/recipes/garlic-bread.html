    <ol>
        <li>Prehead the oven.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until garlic is soft, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Set the oven to broil.</li>
        <li>Slice bread loaf in half horizontally; place cut-side up on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Squeeze garlic cloves from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir in butter, Parmesan cheese, and parsley until well blended. Spread onto the cut sides of bread. </li>
        <li>Broil bread until toasted, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
